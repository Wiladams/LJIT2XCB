# LJIT2XCB
LuaJIT binding to X protocol C Binding (XCB)

This is more of an experiment than anything meant to be actually useful.
I wanted the binding to see how well it might match up with lua coroutines
and scheduling. It should be a fairly natural fit.

Perhaps there is reason to believe an XLB could be created.
